# 🛡️ Security Testing Plan for Capture
 
**Goal:** Validate the security of Capture's authentication system using a hands-on, learn-by-doing approach — starting with manual tests, then escalating to tool-assisted ethical hacking.
 
---
 
## 🔰 Phase 1: Manual Testing (Weeks 1–2)
 
### 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the structure and flow of Capture’s authentication system
- Perform basic security tests by hand
- Learn how vulnerabilities can arise through real examples
 
### 📚 Setup
 
| Step | Tool / Resource |
|------|------------------|
| Install local/staging instance of Capture | Docker |
| Set up test accounts | Include users with varying permissions |
| Install developer tools | Browser DevTools, Postman, Mailtrap |
 
### 🔍 Tests to Run
 
#### 🔑 Authentication Workflows
 
| Test | Target | Expected Outcome |
|------|--------|------------------|
| OTP Reuse | Passwordless Email Login | Second use should fail |
| Email Enumeration | Login Form | Same error for existing/non-existing users |
| OAuth Redirect Injection | OAuth Login | Modified `redirect_uri` should be rejected |
| WebAuthn Replay | Passkey Login | Replay attack should fail due to challenge mismatch |
 
#### 🧪 Input Validation
 
| Test | Target | Example Input |
|------|--------|---------------|
| SQL Injection | Login or Profile Update Fields | `' OR 1=1--` |
| Script Injection (XSS) | Comment/Input Fields | `<script>alert(1)</script>` |
| Rate Limiting | OTP Submission | 10+ rapid attempts with invalid OTPs |
 
✍️ **Deliverable:** Record results in a markdown file and add to docs/ folder.

## 🧨 Phase 2: Tool-Assisted Ethical Hacking (Weeks 3–4)
 
### 🎯 Objectives
- Explore how automated tools find vulnerabilities
- Learn to intercept and modify traffic
- Practice simulating real-world attacker behavior (ethically)
 
### 🔧 Tools to Learn
 
| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **OWASP ZAP** | Spidering, passive/active scans |
| **Burp Suite (Community Edition)** | Intercept HTTP traffic |
| **sqlmap** | Automate SQL injection checks |
| **Postman** | Modify and replay requests |
| **Playwright (optional)** | Automate browser testing for WebAuthn |
 
### 🛠 Suggested Activities
 
| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Passive Scan with ZAP | Point ZAP at staging site, document any issues |
| Burp Interception | Catch login requests, modify parameters |
| Run sqlmap | Target an input field, observe alerts |
| Simulate OAuth Phishing | Attempt to capture token via manipulated redirect (safely in test env) |
| Bypass Test with Encoded Payload | Attempt to sneak past validation with URL encoding or Base64 |
 
✍️ **Deliverable:** Create a report with each tool:
- What was tested
- What was found (or not)
- What you learned
