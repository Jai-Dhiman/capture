# Comprehensive CI/CD Testing Strategy for Server/Backend

This document outlines a recommended testing strategy for a robust CI/CD pipeline.

## I. Types of Tests

### 1. Unit Tests

*   **Focus:** Individual functions, modules, classes, and Hono handlers in isolation. Verifying the smallest pieces of code work correctly.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Testing utility functions (e.g., data transformation, calculations).
    *   Validating Zod schemas.
    *   Testing individual helper functions within authentication logic (e.g., parts of password hashing if isolatable).
    *   Testing individual GraphQL resolver functions with mocked context and data sources.
*   **Tools:** Vitest (or similar like Jest).
*   **CI Trigger:** On every commit/push to any branch.

### 2. Integration Tests

*   **Focus:** Interactions between different internal components of the application, especially with mocked external services or simulated service bindings (like Cloudflare D1, KV, Queues).
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Authentication Flow:**
        *   `authMiddleware`: Test token validation, user context setting.
        *   `authRouter` endpoints (`/register`, `/login`, `/refresh-token`): Mock D1 and KV; verify JWT generation/handling.
    *   **API Route Handlers with Service Mocks:**
        *   Test Hono routes interacting with (mocked) D1, KV, AI bindings.
    *   **GraphQL Resolvers with Mocked Data Sources:**
        *   Verify resolvers correctly process data from mocked services.
    *   **Queue Handlers:**
        *   Test queue processing logic with mock `MessageBatch` and `Bindings`.
*   **Tools:** Vitest, Miniflare (for simulating Cloudflare environment locally), `msw` (for other HTTP mocks if needed).
*   **CI Trigger:** On every commit/push, especially crucial for Pull Requests (PRs).

### 3. API / End-to-End (E2E) Tests

*   **Focus:** Testing the deployed application\'s API contracts from an external perspective, simulating real client interactions against a running instance of the application.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Full User Lifecycle:** Register -> Login -> Access Protected Route -> Use Refresh Token.
    *   **Core Feature Flows:** Create Post -> Retrieve Post -> Comment -> Like Comment.
    *   Test key GraphQL queries and mutations.
    *   Validate error responses and HTTP status codes for various inputs (valid, invalid, edge cases).
*   **Tools:**
    *   HTTP client library (e.g., `axios`, `node-fetch`, or test framework's built-in request capabilities like Vitest with `supertest`).
    *   Run against a deployed instance (dev/staging/preview environment, or a local instance via Miniflare).
*   **CI Trigger:** On PRs (against a preview/staging environment), after deployment to staging.

### 4. Load Tests

*   **Focus:** System performance, stability, and resource utilization under expected or heavy load. Identifies bottlenecks.
*   **Examples:**
    *   High concurrent user logins.
    *   Simultaneous complex operations (e.g., post creations with media, intensive GraphQL queries).
    *   High traffic to queue-producing endpoints.
    *   **Metrics to Monitor:** API response times (p50, p90, p99), error rates, Worker CPU/memory, D1/KV latency, Queue backlogs.
*   **Tools:** Artillery, k6, JMeter.
*   **Environment:** Dedicated staging or load-testing environment that closely mirrors production scale. **Avoid direct heavy load tests on production without careful planning.**
*   **CI Trigger:** Manually triggered, scheduled (e.g., nightly on staging), or before major releases.

### 5. Security Tests

*   **Focus:** Identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.
*   **Types & Examples:**
    *   **SAST (Static Application Security Testing):** Scan code for vulnerabilities.
        *   Tools: Snyk Code, SonarQube, GitHub Advanced Security (CodeQL).
    *   **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing):** Probe running application for vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
        *   Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite (can be automated).
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Check for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
        *   Tools: `npm audit` / `yarn audit`, Snyk, Dependabot.
    *   **Secrets Scanning:** Ensure no secrets are committed to the repository.
        *   Tools: GitGuardian, TruffleHog, GitHub secret scanning.
    *   **Specific Auth Tests:** Test for flaws in authentication/authorization logic.
*   **CI Trigger:**
    *   SAST, Dependency Scanning, Secrets Scanning: On every commit/PR.
    *   DAST: Periodically or before major releases on a staging environment.

### 6. Contract Tests (Consumer-Driven)

*   **Focus:** Ensuring the API (provider) meets the expectations (contract) defined by its clients (consumers, e.g., frontend app).
*   **Tools:** Pact, PactumJS.
*   **CI Trigger:** On PRs for both consumer and provider. Provider build fails if it breaks a consumer\'s contract.

## II. CI/CD Pipeline Structure (Example Stages)

This illustrates a typical flow. Adapt based on your specific branching strategy and tools.

1.  **Commit Stage (Triggered on every commit/push to any branch):**
    *   **Lint & Format:** Ensure code style consistency.
    *   **Unit Tests:** Run all unit tests.
    *   **(Fast) Integration Tests:** Run a quick subset of integration tests.
    *   **Security Scans (Fast):** SAST, Dependency Scanning, Secrets Scanning.

2.  **Pull Request (PR) Stage (Triggered on PR creation/update to `main`/`develop`):**
    *   **All Commit Stage tasks.**
    *   **Full Integration Tests:** Run the complete suite.
    *   **Build Application:** Ensure the application builds successfully.
    *   **(Optional/Recommended) Deploy to Preview/Ephemeral Environment:** Deploy the PR changes to a temporary environment.
    *   **API/E2E Tests:** Run against the preview environment (if deployed) or a staging-like environment.

3.  **Staging Deployment Stage (Triggered on merge to `main`/`develop` or a dedicated staging branch):**
    *   **Build Application.**
    *   **Deploy to Staging Environment.**
    *   **Full API/E2E Tests:** Run against the Staging environment.
    *   **(Optional/Scheduled) Load Tests:** Run against Staging.
    *   **(Optional/Scheduled) DAST:** Run against Staging.

4.  **Production Deployment Stage (Triggered on tag/release, or manually from Staging):**
    *   **Deploy to Production Environment.**
    *   **Smoke Tests:** Run a critical subset of API/E2E tests against Production to verify core functionality.
    *   **Monitoring:** Closely monitor application performance and error rates post-deployment.

## III. Key Considerations

*   **Miniflare:** Highly recommended for local development and running integration/E2E tests. It simulates the Cloudflare Workers environment (bindings, KV, D1, Queues).
*   **Environment Management:** Maintain strict separation of configurations and resources (D1 databases, KV namespaces, secrets) for different environments (dev, test, staging, production). Use Wrangler environments and robust secrets management.
*   **Test Data Management:** Develop strategies for seeding necessary data for tests and cleaning it up, especially for E2E and load tests.
*   **Parallelization:** Configure CI/CD jobs to run in parallel where possible to speed up feedback.
*   **Feedback Loops:** Ensure test results are clearly reported and easily accessible to developers. Failed tests should block promotion to the next stage.
*   **Iterative Approach:** Start by implementing foundational tests (unit, integration, basic API) and gradually add more complex ones (load, advanced security).
